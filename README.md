Computer vision algorithm development for Bootle Blast, a mixed-reality therapy tool built at Pearl Lab (Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital).

## About the Project

Bootle Blast is a theraputic game desgined by Pearl Lab at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehbaillitation Hospital. It currently comprises of 15 different mini games each desgined to support and reinforce different movemnt patterns from upper to lower limb movement. Of these 15, 5  integrate mixed reality elemetns, requriing the player to grasp and move real life objects to trasnate to in game progress. Bootle Blast uses a 3D camera-computer (Orbbec Persee) as well as body tracking software in order to capture 19 differnet landmarks in order to accumulate valuable data and track changes over time. Currently, a combination of skeletal tracking and RGB camera is used to track both the player and the coloured objects. However, ran into difficulty -> with partial occlusion of blocks as well as distance not accurate and fine movemnts.

built in unity

The purpose of this repository is to develop modern tools for computer vision
